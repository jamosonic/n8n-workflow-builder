            "selftext": "I 42M, have two kids living with me, my daughter Anya (17F) and my stepson Noah (14M). Noah’s mom passed a few years ago, and I’ve had full custody since. He’s had a rough go of it, but he’s a good kid, with his quirks. He’s not antisocial or shy, but he does not appreciate having his space invaded and when very upset, he can kinda 'shut down'. \n\nAnya is much more outgoing and has a lot of friends- she asked to have a sleepover this weekend with four of them. I said yes, of course, but given that the friends who were coming were pretty loud and have a tendency to crowd Noah, I told her to make sure they don't go into her brother's room. Also to keep things down after 11, so that the house can sleep. \n\nIn my opinion, these are not strict rules.\n\nTo my surprise, I came upstairs to check on them at about 10- they are 17, I didn't think I needed to check on them every hour or something- and they were in Noah’s room. And they looked like they'd been there a while, two were literally sitting on his bed, with him there, one of them was flipping through his sketchbook, another was messing with his other stuff, and they were all kind of giggling in this weird way.\n\nNoah was clearly upset, he didn't say anything/move, but there were tears in his eyes and he didn't respond when I tried to talk to him. I told the girls to get out right then, and that I was calling every single one of their parents. Anya was pretty upset with me, but I told her that I gave them TWO rules and they failed spectacularly. \n\nI did actually call all of their parents, and sent them home as soon as possible. Anya blew up, saying I embarrassed her. I told her to go to her room, and that we would speak on this in the morning. I spent about 20 minutes with Noah, before he decided he wanted to cool down on his own, and I went back to my daughter- who chose not to speak to me. \n\nIts late, both of my kids are (hopefully) asleep, and I'm left not knowing if i handled things right.

Noah’s mom passed a few years ago, and I’ve had full custody since. He’s had a rough go of it, but he’s a good kid, with his quirks. He’s not antisocial or shy, but he does not appreciate having his space invaded and when very upset, he can kinda &amp;#39;shut down&amp;#39;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anya is much more outgoing and has a lot of friends- she asked to have a sleepover this weekend with four of them. I said yes, of course, but given that the friends who were coming were pretty loud and have a tendency to crowd Noah, I told her to make sure they don&amp;#39;t go into her brother&amp;#39;s room. Also to keep things down after 11, so that the house can sleep. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, these are not strict rules.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To my surprise, I came upstairs to check on them at about 10- they are 17, I didn&amp;#39;t think I needed to check on them every hour or something- and they were in Noah’s room. And they looked like they&amp;#39;d been there a while, two were literally sitting on his bed, with him there, one of them was flipping through his sketchbook, another was messing with his other stuff, and they were all kind of giggling in this weird way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Noah was clearly upset, he didn&amp;#39;t say anything/move, but there were tears in his eyes and he didn&amp;#39;t respond when I tried to talk to him. I told the girls to get out right then, and that I was calling every single one of their parents. Anya was pretty upset with me, but I told her that I gave them TWO rules and they failed spectacularly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did actually call all of their parents, and sent them home as soon as possible. Anya blew up, saying I embarrassed her. I told her to go to her room, and that we would speak on this in the morning. I spent about 20 minutes with Noah, before he decided he wanted to cool down on his own, and I went back to my daughter- who chose not to speak to me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Its late, both of my kids are (hopefully) asleep, and I&amp;#39;m left not knowing if i handled things right. AITA?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Since I’m doing okay enough to right now, I offered to help her out with food. \n\nI do a budgeting plan with my meals/meal prep where I use these compartment containers and I’ll make 10 portions of 3 different meals every two weeks. I rotate the menu based on what’s on sale. Then I put them into my deep freezer. I have adhd and this works really well for me. I have a bit of extra meal stock at the moment because I don’t always eat all the prepared trays before I make the next batch since i always do it every two weeks. I have around 25 extra meals in my freezer right now. \n\nSince I have extra, I was originally just gonna not meal prep at the start of next week, but instead I decided to offer to drop my friend off some of my surplus so she has something to eat. \n\nI was gonna drop it off today after work, but right when I was getting off work I was watching Snapchat stories and saw she posted one. She went and got a tattoo today as part of a Friday the 13th flash thing. I’m familiar with the artist who did the tatt because I recognized their flash from their instagram. I was considering going in for one but didn’t do it cause I don’t really have the extra money rn. They’re all pre priced prices and that one is $180 \n\nIdk why but it kinda pmo because she literally just told me about how she was so broke she couldn’t afford to eat, but yet was able to pay for a tattoo. When I was struggling financially I def didn’t get tattoos. I messaged her about it and asked about how she was able to afford a tattoo and she basically just said “I’m always able to scrounge up cash for new tattoos” \n\nI then told her that I’m not bringing her those meals because if she has enough for a new tattoo, she must not be that desperate. She freaked out on me and called me a bitch and said I was being classist and that poor people are allowed to have nice things. Which I do agree with, but I feel like it doesn’t apply to this situation. But now I feel like an asshole and my friend is mad at me. Aita? ",

After the divorce was finalized his parental rights were terminated voluntarily due to chronic issues with homelessness and lack of treatment for his gambling/alcohol addictions. And part of the court order that went with his termination of his rights was that we were not to contact each other. \n\nPost divorce, he had two other children (both boys) with another woman. He reached out to me a few days ago and texted the following:\n\nRumpleforeskin: Hey how are the boys? If they ever want to see their brothers just let me know. I have them on my days off.\n\nSide note, yes that is his contact name in my phone. \n\nMy response to him was that if my boys wanted to see their brother's I would go through their mother. I have a relatively friendly relationship with her and the boys have met twice. His response to back to me was that I was rude and that my answer was uncalled for and that he had done nothing to deserve it. \n\nTo be clear, our eldest is in therapy because of him and the trauma surrounding his dad's abuse of me. Since then I've blocked his number (which I thought I had after we were done with court), but some people are saying that I just should have just ignored him.\n\nSo, AITA in how I responded?",

We had fun together taking turns and Boris eventually set a substantial high score, and then he told me he wanted to take a toy as a prize as he pointed towards the giant stuffed animal I had purchased for \"Moris\" (another grandson who has different parents than Boris and Doris)'s 6th birthday. I explained to him that he can't have the stuffed animal as it's for Moris's birthday, but he insisted that since he won he deserved a prize. I explained that this arcade machine doesn't give out prizes like in an actual arcade but my words fell on deaf ears as Boris ran towards the stuffed animal. \n\nI asked \"Bessy\" (Boris's mother, my daughter) if she could tell Boris that he can't have the stuffed animal, but instead of doing anything, she suggested that I let Boris have this stuffed animal and get a different stuffed animal for Moris. I told Bessy this would not happen as the only available giant stuffed animals here are very expensive. \n\nI ended up having to ban Boris from the garage until he learnt to respect other people's belongings, but this made him very upset and now Bessy is also cross with me for treating Boris unfairly. I thought this matter would resolve itself quickly but Bessy is still cross with me and seems to still have some expectation I procure a stuffed animal for Boris.",

At one point the woman next to me said she loved that I was ‘embracing my feminine hair’. I haven’t shaved my underarms for a while so I guess it was more noticeable than I realised. I kind of just awkwardly laughed, said thanks and that I was ‘just lazy’ and turned to chat to my friend.\n\nFor context, I’m pale and have dark hair so it can be noticeable. I also have PCOS so I grow more hair than ‘average’. I’m quite insecure about this (I dermablade under my chin regularly cause I hate the dark ‘more than peach fuzz’ I grow). But I also have sensitive skin so sometimes I just choose not to shave.\n\nAnyways the woman next to me and her friend kept getting progressively drunker as the film went on. At the end she turned to me and again started commenting on how much she ‘loved’ that I didn’t shave. She kept going on about how she wished she was ‘brave’ and I just snapped. I told her to stop, that I wasn’t being brave, I had a personal medical condition I’m still insecure about and to stop commenting about how my body is different. She got silent, mumbled a sorry and walked off with her friend. We passed them again when they were leaving and she looked like she had been crying. \n\nMy friend said I was too harsh and she was just drunkenly trying to complement me. I said it didn’t feel like a compliment when she’s pointing out how different I am. My friend said I had earlier complimented a woman’s hair and she was a different race to me, so it was similar.\n\nIt’s starting to get to me. Obviously this drunk woman didn’t know about my issues with body hair but it made me so uncomfortable repeatedly bringing it up.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for snapping at a woman who kept commenting about my underarm hair?\n\nEdit: typos",
