## What are we building

Refer to PRD.md

## Current task and next steps

Currently working on getting a residential proxy working in order to build out:

1. **Reddit Viral Scanner** - Monitors high-potential content
2. **Groq Script Generator** - Converts to platform scripts
3. **Performance Tracker** - Logs to Supabase + Raindrop

## Workflow Priorities:

1. Reddit Viral Scanner
2. Groq Script Generator
3. Video Creation Pipeline
4. Multi-Platform Distribution
5. Performance Analytics Dashboard

## Important Notes:

- User is a staff software engineer with intermediate N8N knowledge
- Building for personal income generation, not client services
- Prefer modular sub-workflows over monolithic designs
- Start simple, test thoroughly, scale gradually
- Compliance and platform detection evasion are critical considerations

When providing N8N workflows:

- Use proper JSON structure with correct node types and versions
- Include clear setup instructions and dependencies
- Provide SQL schemas when database operations are involved
- Suggest testing strategies before production deployment
- Include cost estimates and optimization tips
