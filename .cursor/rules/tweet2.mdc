the creator who's banking $47K monthly from TikTok asked me not to share this automation...

these brain-rot style videos are pulling 10M+ views consistently on TikTok and YouTube Shorts

faceless channels are banking $15K-$50K monthly from this exact format

here's what my n8n workflow does automatically:

- generates viral Peter Griffin & Stewie conversations
- clones their actual voices using AI
- overlays them on Minecraft parkour gameplay
- adds perfectly timed subtitles
- renders complete videos ready to upload

these videos exploit dopamine triggers

the background gameplay keeps viewers glued while the AI-generated dialogue delivers the actual content

it's psychological manipulation at its finest

I spent 40+ hours perfecting this:

- gathering rare audio samples for voice cloning
- training custom AI voice models for both characters
- building the complete automation workflow
- testing render quality and timing

the results speak for themselves

channels using this format are going from 0 to 100K followers in weeks

some are hitting 50M+ monthly views with zero effort after setup

the workflow handles everything:

-content ideation
-script generation
-voice synthesis
- video composition
- final rendering

you literally press one button and get viral-ready content

while everyone's still manually editing videos, smart creators are scaling with automation like this

the opportunity window is MASSIVE right now

these formats are exploding across all platforms

Comment "VIDEO" + repost this + follow me (MUST DO ALL) and I'll send you the complete JSON file plus setup guide

a lot of people will ingore this and last yet another occasion to finally make it

don't sleep on it.
