I spent 47 hours building what might be the most profitable n8n workflow ever created

it's generating $50K/month in "brainrot" videos while I sleep.

these "Reddit story" videos are pulling 50M+ views consistently

and I'm about to show you the exact money printer that faceless creators are using to hit 6-figures

here's what this machine does:

- scrapes viral Reddit stories from any Reddit's post URL
- generates AI voice over
- adds Minecraft parkour background footage that triggers dopamine hits
- automatically syncs AI voiceover with animated subtitles
- renders and exports vertical videos ready for TikTok/YouTube Shorts

numbers don't lie

one workflow run = 1 video ready to upload

zero editing.
zero manual work.
pure automation.

I reverse-engineered what the biggest faceless channels are doing

they're not just posting random content

they cracked the dopamine algorithm:
- background gameplay keeps eyes glued
- AI voices create parasocial connection
- reddit drama hooks emotional investment
- vertical format maximizes mobile retention

the secret sauce isn't the content

it's the systematic production at scale.

while everyone's manually editing videos for hours

smart ones are running workflows that pump out viral content 24/7

this workflow handles the entire pipeline:

✓ Content Scraping
✓ Voice generation
✓ Video composition
✓ Subtitle timing

the same system printing money for channels with 500K+ subscribers.

but here's the kicker...

most people will bookmark this and never take action.

the ones who do? they'll be running their own content empire within 30 days
